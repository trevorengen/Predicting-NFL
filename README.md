**NFL Score/Win Predictor**

---------------------------------------

This notebook uses the ELO data provided by FiveThirtyEight in order to make predictions on outcomes of NFL games.

Currently the best I've gotten for accuracy is 65.7% on a sample of n=1000 games that were not included in the training or validation data.

All code is my own but feel free to use it if you'd like.
